During the academic period, first studying at the <5>ITIS Enrico Fermi of Mantua</5> and then at the <7>University of Padua</7>, I learned the development skills of a software application in its totality.<9/><10/>I mainly develop on the <12>Back-end</12> part of the applications, which must be scalable, functional and safe to guarantee an optimal result. However, I am interested to challenge me and to expand my cultural background with new technologies and different topics.<14/>Currently I live in a small town in the province of Mantua, but sometimes I'm located in the city of Padua.<16/>Contact me!"
